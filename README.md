# Movie Database - NodeJS version

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mlex/movie-database-node.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mlex/movie-database-node)

Another version of the legendary movie database. This time with NodeJS. The app
is being deployed to Heroku after every push. Feel free to check it out:

## System requirements

### Node.js

*Make sure that you have [node.js with NPM](http://nodejs.org/) installed on
your machine. You also need a Neo4j instance listening
on* `http://127.0.0.1:7474`.

This project uses a standard node.js module descriptor (`package.json`) and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as a tool for test execution and static source
code analysis. To install the project's dependencies, simply run `npm install`
in the project's root directory. This will make sure that the development tools
are locally installed.

To make use of Grunt, you further need to have its CLI tool on your path.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

The most useful Grunt tasks currently are `simplemocha` for test execution and
`jshint` for static source code analysis. To execute these tasks, simple call
Grunt:

```
grunt simplemocha
```

## Automatically restarting the express server on file changes

Automatically restarting the server on file changes is desirable as this
increases your development pace.
[Supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) can help you with this.

```
# To install supervisor
npm install -g supervisor

# Then run the server
supervisor src/server.js
```
